# fraud_detector
AI-powered fraud detection system using XGBoost to identify suspicious transactions in real time. Built with React, Next.js, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL, with Dask for scalable data processing. Combines full-stack development and machine learning to enhance payment security.


# AI-Powered Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project is a full-stack **fraud detection system** that leverages **machine learning (XGBoost)** to detect suspicious financial transactions in real time. It integrates **AI-driven anomaly detection** with an interactive dashboard for financial analysts, enhancing payment security and transparency.

## Features
- 🚀 Real-time transaction monitoring with fraud flagging
- 🔍 AI-powered fraud detection using **XGBoost**
- 📊 Interactive dashboard built with **React** and **Next.js** for visualization
- ⚡ Efficient data processing using **Dask** for large-scale financial data
- 🗄️ Backend API built with **FastAPI**, connected to **PostgreSQL** for secure data storage
- 📬 Supports real-time alert generation for high-risk transactions

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Dask, XGBoost, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript
- **Machine Learning:** XGBoost for classification, MinMaxScaler for preprocessing
- **Data Processing:** Dask for scalable data handling

## How It Works
1. Transactions are ingested and stored in PostgreSQL.
2. Data is processed using **Dask** to handle large volumes efficiently.
3. Transactions are evaluated by a **pre-trained XGBoost model**, which assigns a fraud probability.
4. Results are displayed in a **React dashboard**, with high-risk transactions flagged for review.
5. Analysts can drill down into individual transactions, viewing features that contributed to the risk score.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fraud-detection-system.git
    ```
2. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
4. Run backend:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
5. Run frontend:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add real-time webhook integration for instant fraud alerts.
- Enhance ML model with ensemble methods for improved accuracy.
- Add user role management for different analyst permissions.
